# States of the world

Using Python, I created a crawler which enters the Wikipedia pages with the countries of the world and retains in a database information such as: name, capital name, population, density, area, neighbors, language spoken, time zone, type of political regime (democratic, monarchy, etc). Also, an API built in Python over the database has multiple routes, called with the HTTP GET method. These calls return the top 10 countries with the highest large population, highest density, highest surface, countries with a specific time zone, neighbour, language or political regime.
